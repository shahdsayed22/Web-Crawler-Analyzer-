# Web Crawler & Analyzer

## Overview

This project is a web crawler that analyzes a given website for crawlability, extracts key metadata (such as title and links), and provides the best approach to access its data (HTML, Sitemap, RSS, or API). It supports JavaScript rendering using Playwright for dynamic content extraction.

## Features

- **Content Extraction**: Extracts metadata like title and links from the page.
- **JavaScript Rendering**: Handles pages with JavaScript using Playwright for rendering.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: A simple dashboard to visualize the crawl results, including metadata and links.
